// Given a string S that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into N + 1 groups by N dashes. Also given an integer K.

// We want to reformat the string S, such that each group contains exactly K characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than K but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.

// Return the reformatted string.

// Example 1:

// Input:
// S = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", K = 4
// Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
// Explanation: The string S has been split into two
// parts, each part has 4 characters. Note that two
// extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
// Example 2:

// Input:
// S = "2-5g-3-J", K = 2
// Output: "2-5G-3J"
// Explanation: The string s has been split
// into three parts, each part has 2 characters
// except the first part as it could
// be shorter as mentioned above.
